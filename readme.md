Responsive Timeline
===================
Vertical timeline which i created for a personal project.
Created using [Gulp][1] and Sass.

To free edit install Gulp after clone the project:

```
$ npm install gulp
```

Install the packages:
```
$ npm install gulp-ruby-sass gulp-imagemin del
```
Use the default task from Gulp for run all tasks:
```
$ gulp
```
And for watch changes in project use:
```
$ gulp watch
```

and have fun! =)
